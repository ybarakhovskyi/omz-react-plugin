# âš› omz-react-plugin
A barely small plugin for [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#readme) to simplify creation of React components.

Maybe it will get some additional functionality in the future.

## How to install
Simply, just run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ybarakhovskyi/omz-react-plugin.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/react
```

## How to use

For now there is two aliases you can use:
1) `remc <name>` creates a directory and all necessary files in it for component with provided name
2) `remtc <name>` does same thing but using TypeScript

Also plugin provides standalone command `react` for use in console. 
You can use `react -h` to see what it's capable for.
